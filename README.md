For this project, the following technologies have been used:
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Running the Project
The test development has been carried out following these steps:
To start the project, first, we need to install the dependencies. To do this, navigate to the project root directory and execute:
```bash
npm install
```
Once this is done, the node_modules (which contains the dependencies from package.json) and package-lock.json will be autogenerated.
After the dependencies are installed, to initiate the project, execute:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Finally, open the browser with the URL specified in the terminal to visualize the project.

To run the tests
```bash
npm run test
```
